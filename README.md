## Description

Out of our passion to solve the issue of time waste in the robot creation process, EZ-Builder was born. The EZ-Builder software platform reduces the time it takes to get from idea to implementation. Since 2011 we have been listening to the challenges robot builders encounter and continue to provide them with an ever expanding toolbox of solutions. Join us on this journey!

We didn't stop at the software, we also made time saving hardware solutions. This IPS transmitter reference design is one of them. The IPS transmitter shines a 150° invisible infrared light beam that is picked up by the IPS's infrared camera. A unique feature of this IR transmitter is that it has an extremely wide angle of infrared light dispersion that can be picked up even when the IPS is directly perpendicular to the LED. It also has built-in LED driver circuit that consumes less current, and generates less heat than using classic resistor current limiting. We want to share these files with you so you can create your own version for your community and customers to enjoy!

## EZ-Builder Behavior Control

The EZ-Builder behavior control for this reference design is very easy to use! Simply click on the area you'd like the robot to move to and it moves there!
